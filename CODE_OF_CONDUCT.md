# Be respectful
Like many forms of communication, news sources are often biased to a degree, which can lead to debate. In general, political discourse is good and should be encouraged, but Github is not the place for it. To keep everything sane and civil, please abide by these rules.

- The purpose of this project is to provide a way to access news articles in NeoVim; NOT to censor news or draw the line on what is legitimate enough to be news. As long as the news source is providing recent updates somewhere in the world, it will be considered a valid news source.
- All comments on issues or PRs must solely be about technical concerns. There should be no politicaly motivated speech on here; that is what friends and family is for.
- All PRs to add news sources will be welcome provided they are up to standards and the news source is returning a collection of recent events somewhere in this world.
